# Trajektoria

Aplication created as project for programing class at Warsaw Univeristy of Technology.
This program is used to determine ballistic trajectory of object, which is a path of the body in a presence of atmosphere.
This problem doesn't have a general analytical solution, that's why I had to use numerical attitude for this one.
Basically it means that program divides path into steps and then calculates new conditions, after ever tiny time interval
#
#Program was built in a QT IDE, which was a requirement, that's why it use windowded GUI.
